                              A system information view for a-shell terminal on iOS
                        
What is Neofetch for iPad?
--------------------------
Neofetch for iPad is a project that is actively maintained and a new stable version comes
out every month. I am constantly working hard to give yall a good experience for 
non-jailbroken and/or non-jailbreakable iOS. iOS 17 and above is not jailbreakable, so I
have stepped in and decided to make a sh script that works on a-shell, which is a local
terminal for iPhone and iPad.

Where can I get a-shell?

Download on iOS and iPadOS (GitHub repository)
----------------------------------------------
First, make sure you have a-shell. you can download that from the app store
on iPhone or iPad.
Then, scroll up to the 'releases' section and click 'stable' (reccommended)
or 'Beta' (not recommended)
Next, press a 'vX.X.X' tab, then download the 'Release X.X.X.zip' file.
Once that's done, go into the files app,go into the downloads folder, 
decompress the zip file, then movethe file that says 'nofetch' into the 
'a-shell' folder in the 'On My iPad' scree or the 'On My iPhone' screen, 
depending on the device you use.
